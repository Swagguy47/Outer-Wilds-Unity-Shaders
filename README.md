# Outer Wilds Shaders

This project is my attempt at recreating some Unity shaders from Outer Wilds

These were created using ASE for simplicity


These shaders are not intended as 1-1 replicas with the same parameters and output, but rather my own custom approaches with similar enough inputs to get a close result.

------------------------------------------

Here are some notable examples so far:

(Standard fire)

(Blackhole and its distortion)

(Ghostbird skin setup in inspector)

![Image](src/owMatEx.jpg)

(Some of the included premade materials, mostly just fire stuff)

------------------------------------------

There are some more than what is shown here.

Credits to Mobius Digital and Annapurna Interactive for making such an amazing game.
I take no credit for their work.
Note that some assets for the example materials are from Outer Wilds' data.



I would not recommend using these shaders for commercial purposes.
